(Brian Smith put the E minor into the verse)
D D/C# GMaj7/B G *
Gmaj7/B can also be called Bmsus4, played x20032
*on this intro and the chorus, the lead guitar just alternates between D and G, but I think there's also rhythm (or just a "feel", using the bass
somehow, of a progression through D, Asus, Bm and G. See the Tab (!) below.
[A]Inside himself, He [Em]runs to look in the [G]mirror
[A]And the face that stares right back has [Em]never been any [G]clearer [A]But look at the doubt in his eyes [Bm]He's not the one to [C]blame
D D/C# GMaj7/B
It was a different man, no he's never been here
G D
You can be so close, you can be so near
D/C# GMaj7/B
It was a different man, playing different cards
G D (overlaps start of verse)
You can be so soft, you can be so hard
Inside himself, He follows the wrong directions
Perfect English words all right But with the wrong inflections
But look at the dust at his feet He's not the one she loves
It was a different man, no he's never been found
You can be so up, you can be so down
It was a different man, no he's never been there
You can be halfway, you can be all there (repeat first chorus)
Instrumental bit
D D/C# G/B G
G Em C D
Em F G
G G/F# CMaj7/E C
(NB:this last line is simply the intro transposed one key flat around the chord cycle. I'm not sure of the Em in the second line, but I can't think what else it might be)
Inside himself, He thinks that he looks the same
And the mind that thinks it all out Never noticed any change
But look at the doubt in his eyes He's not the one to blame
And here's the guitar tab for the intro etc...

Intro
Aminor// Aminor7___let ring (x4)
Aminor_____
Tiny drops of water glistened on her black fur
Aminor_____
Taillights in earshot, headlights shine through her
Fmajor7
Legs crossed on the red surge settee
Fmajor7
Sat next to nothing as she looked right through me, and on Aminor
Inside the car sat a sulky blonde
Aminor
And on her lap, the road went on and on
Fmajor7
As she dresses, I look to the ground
Fmajor7
Perhaps I know where the place can be found, and on
Aminor// Aminor7____(x2)
Chorus
C------------G/B-------------Aminor
Outside, the night is very soft, but where does it end?
C-----------------------------------G/B---------------------Aminor
We pile into the Buick, but you've got to have money for that
Aminor
92 people take it way too fast
Aminor
They never notice where their lines are cast, and on Fmajor7
Legs crossed on the red surge settee
Fmajor7
Sat next to nothing, and she looked right through me, and on Aminor
I've got a milk-white electric guitar
Aminor
Walked in the shop and I peeled off the notes, oh yeah
Fmajor7
As she dresses, I look to the ground
Fmajor7
Perhaps I know where the place can be found, and on

                            (duh) but you just keep playing the xxx(10)(11)(10) instead of
                            picking it the second and third times through.

                            This is my first go at tabing and I am going by memory
                            as I don't have the record available at the moment. At
                            least it's in the same key as the Chord transcription
                            below. Transcription is in 1/16 notes. A "." below a note is a dotted note.

So down to the beach just out of reach
The moon was being trailed
A girl and a sailor and a hot dog trailer
That's their holy grail
The sand whispered heat and burned the feet
Of gulls landing on the shore
In the motel pool the waitress cools
She doesn't ask for more
She makes a wish she takes a risk
She opens up her door
Through human eyes she's a dolphin in disguise
It's the last night of the war
Somewhere far away there's another day
And someone's getting out of bed
She put on her face in the morning space
She doesn't know she's dead
Her [G]ruby lips can't [F]excite me any[C]more
And [Dm]pain sprawls on the [F]chair, it's always [C]there
And [Dm]he descends the [F]stairs, he doesn't [C]see
The [Dm]sunburnt landlord [F]glares, for all the [C]people [Dm]
He can [F]never be [C] [Dm]

(Kilbey)
[D]Oceanic lights are cleverly dim
Blueish features in the lower reaches
We raise out traffic flares to him
Fishnet, girlish the red ones spark
Holy arcs tracked in the dark
The more I see the less I look
Here's another name I took
Listen! In the early morning air
The remnants of their evening wear
Branching off, the road winds east
Deluxe locations just near completion
Come dine with wine and oyster feast
The pearls are real, have one for free
They're washed up by the foam waved sea
The more I look the less I smile
Never mind let's stay awhile
The fans blow secrets on the night
Out of mind but not out of sight
Is this where you live
[D]Broken voices the nylon choir
Nothing left to stoke that fire
[F]All they own is on their tongues
[D]They never see or wonder if
[G]Is this where you [D]live
[D]Thin dog's don't vie for bones
Why desert just to be alone
[F]All they own is on their backs
[D]They can't believe it's you I'm with
[G]Is this where you [D]live
[D]Don't blush as I brush your touch
No need for any speed or rush
[F]All you own is on the floor
[D]I'm buying all you're gonna give
[G]Is this where you [D]live
[D]Coffee stories the lying truth
Electric lights don't help my youth
[F]All I owned is on my face
[D]Urbane mirror anger myth
[G]Is this where you [D]live

Andy says:
I have done the solo in tablature form - it is almost the same as the solo from the other transcription down below but there are a couple of variations. It shows the double-notes towards the end of the solo and I use a slightly different set of chords - I've shown the chord changes where I make them when playing it. Also, during the verse, I use a G instead of one of the Em chords.

D* is between D x00232 and Dsus4 x00233 (sometimes D+2 x00230 is thrown in too!)
G* is between G 320033 and G6 320030
A7sus4* is between A7sus4 002033 and a different A7sus4 002030, and
sometimes good ol' A7 002020
A/Eb is played x01220 (and sounds pretty horrible! The Church play it with Steve hitting an Eb on the bass as Marty (?) plays an A)

So alone

caret's indicate a harmonic.
the spaces between notes sorta says how the rythym goes, but there is not really any separation except bars, and that might even be dodgy.

And you stand there, with ashes blowing past
Dipping into gilt-edged love that will be made at last And the gold you spend and the hastening end
That you throw into the sea
Coming back a hundredfold, there's no guarantee
{c:Chorus}
We'll walk and be like giants, we'll all be honest men I go back to my blindness so that I may see again
A woman standing on a hill is gazing out to sea
Dreaming of a new age waiting there for me
I call her from a distance and she smiles into the sun And men and gods begin their dance, for their time has begun And holy wars extended and battlefields of pain
Washed away, forgotten in the perfect rain
Princes, kings and humble things are well-worn and content Messengers come everywhere, envoys have been sent

(Lift on and off B-string 2nd fret on the A and Dmaj7 chords)
[A]Like a womb, night was all [Dmaj7/F#]around
[A]Someone, somewhere must have talked some sense
I could [Dmaj7/F#]feel it moving underground
[G]So many things I still don't under[E]stand
The [A]dream I was having took on an ugly [Dmaj7/F#]face
I don't [A]know if I was walking through heaven
It could have been [Dmaj7/F#]any place
[G]Skipping 'cross the water, wading through the [Esus4] sand [E]
A[Dmaj/F#]wake to find you gone, emptiness is where you [A]lay
I just [Dmaj7/F#]had to smile for all the things you'll never [E]hear me say
[C]Oh, I know, I could never get that [G]near
[Dmaj7/F#]What do you expect me to do, disap[A]pear? [G]
{soc}
[G]You and [C]me, [em]we're as [D]free as we can [G]be
Can't you [C]see, [em]like the [D]trees so obviously[am]... [A]
{eoc}
The message disturbs me so I throw it to the wind
And after all the hellos goodbyes etc etc
We can't start this thing again
It's like the fog you walk towards, but never seem to reach
Every morning now I hear that same old song
And though the singer is long dead, his voice goes on and on
Ugliness you have to learn, but beauty you can't teach
F#m A
Awake to find you gone, a note pinned to my sleeve
F#m
It wasn't just the things you took
E
It was the things you had to leave
C G
Now it seems you were never here
DMaj7 A
What do you expect me to do, disappear?

And I've been waiting for ages, yes I've been here all the time There was this greed in my blood, she let me take the easy way She helps me hide the vagabond, that was myself yesterday And after the acting, I found that I couldn't sleep
And during my drifting, I found that I was too deep
By the virtue of faith
I knew that I could be lost
Beyond this dark place
Unprepared to pay the cost

As the tide sweeps out another mile

Strangers in their naked skin
Waiting for their sweet oblivion
Close to you, hear all you say
Even though you're continents away
The perfumed air, the taste of fear
Shrug your shoulders and they disappear
Take this gift and let it grow
Let it be all the hope you know
It doesn't change [E]

Cut my losses, grow my hair, see some man to take me there

For the more proficient :), there are several picking parts, notably the intro/ending, where there are two guitars:
|------------------|------------------|
|------------------|------------------|
|---0---0---0---0--|---0---0---0---0--|
|--0---0-0-0---0-0-|--0---0-0-0---0-0-|
|-----2---3---2----|-----2---3--------|

and
|-----0-------3----|-----0------------|
|-013--310-13------|-013--310-13------|
|------------------|-------------0----|
|------------------|------------------|
|------------------|------------------|
|------------------|------------------|
Then the bridge part, (chords F C G) which has a slidey part ( an equals sign here means slide to the second note...Frets are numbered in hexadecimal, so A=10, B=11 etc)
|-3=A-9=A-9=A-3-|-3=5-3=5--------|
|---------------|---------5=8----|
|---------------|----------------|
|---------------|----------------|
|---------------|----------------|
|---------------|----------------|
Then back to the G, Gsus pattern for a frightening lead part (done on 12-string, so this is only approximate)
|----------03-7----|-CA8A87-ZZZ-3=F---|
|-------013---8----|----------------h-|
|-----02------9----|----------------h-|
|---02-------------|------------------|
|-23---------------|------------------|
|------------------|------------------|
ZZZ is a trill played on the 10th, 8th and 7th frets somehow, possibly with the 2nd and 3rd strings in there too. The slide goes up from the 3rd to the 15th fret, and is followed by 5th fret harmonics on the 2nd and 3rd
strings. OK, I admit it MWP is a bloody good 12-string player! Good luck!!!

Chorus:

You're saying no no no I must be on my way
Em7 G D A7
But it really has been a pleasant night
Em7 G D G
And you go so slow hope they'll ask you to stay   Em7 G D
And indifference gives you a fright
The same pattern continues for the other verses:
Walking outside you come to a door
You go inside and you wonder what for
At least it's good to be out of the wind
You turn around and the clocks all begin
Just like the winter your memory thaws
Just like the ocean your memory pours
So many pieces to match or to find
So many doubts to have in one mind
It's hard to see how the tables have turned
It's hard to see how the people have learned
It's hard to watch the past drizzling past
It's hard to watch them picking the cast
And it stacks up badly that it never makes sense You sense that sensation is who's paying the rent And she beckons to you with her fingers and lies She says: can't you slice the price of your paradise
The sliding lead break in the second and third verses is:

So now we're cruising down this shuddering highway
With a dead sun shining on my back

Struggling like a fool with my junk and my jewels
You would have thought I'd had enough

                        song : `
Here's my interpretation of this song. It's a bit more complex than the chord-based one which follows it.
There seems to be a lot of ways to play this song. When I've seen Steve play it live he goes for a simplified version of the following arrangment, which sounds much like the acoustic performances he and Marty do when sharing the stage.
Chords (strings numbered from low E to high E)
D - 000232
D9 - 000230
G6 - 320000
Em7 - 022030
D9/F# - 200230
A7sus4 - X02030 (try and avoid the low E, but no probs if you can't) F#m - 244222 (like Em, barre second fret)
F#m/A - X04222 This one's a bit awkward to play - avoid the low E Fmaj7 - X03210
Em/A - X05430 Just slide up two frets from Fmaj7
"Here in this desert"...
D G6 (repeat till chorus)
OR D Em7 D9/F# G6
"A gunfight in Dodge City..."
F#m G F#m/A (if you can, otherwise repeat the first chord)
"All my life spent searching..."
Fmaj7 Em/A D - For that second chord just slide up two frets from the   first. Let the A string ring if, or block it if you   don't like the sound.
Here's a simpler, chord-based version.
[D]Here in this [Em7]desert, be[F#m ?]neath the sun and [G]stars
Still troubled by the rumblings of a million distant cars
Please be good to me tonight, let me find my way
The air has some command in it I cannot disobey
[F#m]A gunfight in Dodge [G]City, a [D]murder in Bom[G]bay
[F#m]All these deeds and [G]worldly needs I [D]must shrug off to[G]day [Fmaj7]All my life spent [Em7]searching for pro[D]wess
[Fmaj7]Left me lying [Em7]here with you, tris[D]tesse
I was working in an orchard that grew the strangest fruit
It wasn't Mother Nature that made those trees take root
Your children cannot hear you, they only want your loot
You hold on to their essence like a parachute
They never believed you were in distress
Now you've gone and left them with tristesse
[D]Oh, [G]waters in[A]flamed [G]
[D]Ah, [G]fires burning [A]out [G]
[D]Ah, [G]ice melting [A]down [G]
[D]Ah, [G]fires burnt [A]out [G]
[F#m]A hotel suite in a [G]rich man's town, a [D]hut in Botany [G]Bay A [F#m]prisoner by my [G]own device, a [D]mountain in my [G]way
I'm [Fmaj7]gonna have to [Em7]alter my add[D]ress
Cause [Fmaj7]I can't stay much [Em7]longer with [D]tristesse
[Fmaj7]And they call this [Em7]carnival prog[D]ress
In[Fmaj7]vited by our [Em7]queen tonight, tris[D]tesse

You wake up late, day is still dawning
You set out on the road
You meet up with a man, his face well worn in
He's carrying a load

On the way to paradise

All those empty souls are nearly at the brink

Just their own face reflected in the night

Verse: Am Am7sus4 Fmaj7 G

Extra Credit:
If you have a friend with a capo, get them to put it on the fifth fret and play: Verse: Em Em7sus4 Cmaj7 D
Chorus: D Cmaj7
Bridge/Solo: G D Em
That will really thicken the sound up. Vary your respective rhythms for even more effect.

Bridge: My favourite part. Make the shape of Fmaj7 (F chord with open high E) Then move your hand up the neck so your index finger is on the fifth fret. This is an open A chord. The chords you'll play are: A C/A D9/A Bbaug4/A. But they're all the same chord shape, with the index finger on these frets: 5, then 8 then 10 then 6. Get it ?
The bridge section gets repeated a few times, so start softly, then build in volume and complexity so that by the last time your hand is a blur and the amp is screeching !

Verse:
From Scott:
verses: Dm Dm/C A#maj7 Am
choruses: Gm Am A# C
if you are playing this song by yourself (as so many of us bedroom performers do) you might want to play the full chords as listed for the chorus. for the pedants, you will notice that on the recording, these are played as simple power chords.
Dm xx0231
Dm/C x30231
A#maj7 x13231 or x1323x (if yr lazy like me)
Am x02210
Brian also suggests playing Asus4 for the first two beats of the Am chord...and it works for me, so here's the chord along with my thanks to Brian for the corrections.
Asus4 x02230

Jens has a similar suggestion for the verse:
Dm [xx0231]
Dm4 [xx0233]
Dsus2/A# [x10230]
A7sus4 [x02030]
Cadd9 [x32030]
Dm Dm4 Cadd9 Dsus2/A#
The wine in your hand is worth
A7sus4 Cadd9
two at the bar
And so on. It sounds much better if you do some picking with these chords.
Chorus:
Gm (full chord) 355333 or G5 (power chord) 355xxx
Am (full chord) x02210 or A5 (power chord) x022xx

SOLO
this solo isn't too hard, just alot of work to transcribe, so just
try noodling around in the key of D minor... Marty seems to use
alot of descending runs in this solo (which also features a delay,
or echo, effect throughout).

P=A is my fave album ever, and in my eyes the strongest Church lineup
as well. "Ripple" was the final indication to me that The Church is too
smart for the pop audience--it's a brilliant song. Here it is, sans all the
detail work (if you want it bad enough, you'll figure it out). There's some
good use of half-step modulations between the verse and
chorus--enhances the eerie effect. Also, it's a good display of how

Peter's presence enhances a song. To me, this song is like a fine wine:
rich, dark and bitter. I encourage all bands to try this.
[Am]Tiny baby, [C]so naive
[Dm] I can't believe what [F or Fmaj9] you believe
[Am]You were [C]once so [Dm]happy here [F or Fmaj9]
It may not be Eden or summer in Greece
You may not even find the Golden Fleece
In the drag of this atmosphere
Now I don't want to bring up a delicate matter
No I'd much rather bribe or flatter you
Cause flattery gets me everywhere
But you punctured my tires, you crossed all my wires
I brand your acolytes as a pack of liars
And the fire's singing everywhere
[D#m] (Ripple...)
[F#] Buckle like a wreck in the cold green sea
[D#m]...
[F#] Like you were a ripple in my memory
I lent you some collateral to buy new clothes
It went out the window and up your nose
And that's the end of the honeymoon
Yeah we walk down the aisle for another mile
I'd walk a million miles for one of your smiles
And you can have all the money soon
(Chorus)
(solo 1) [F#m] [A] [G#m] [B]
You're so deluxe, you're so divine
You're so fifty light years ahead of your time
You're a metal, you're a ripple
You're a human sacrifice to the goddess of vice
Your hairdo is full of diamonds and lice
And you're hardly off the nipple
(Chorus)
Another little glitch in continuity
Like you were a ripple in my memory
(Various stuff with the same chords & solo 2)
NOW FOR YOU BASS PLAYERS:
Simple eighth-note feel most of the time. Things are complicated slightly
by Kilbey's use of a Fender VI bass, but if you stick to the main notes
and ignore the open strings, it sounds fine (otherwise just crank up your
treble). This can work on 2nd guitar, too.

Verse:
AAAAAGEG (on E string, strumming open A string too)
AAAAAGEG (same as above)
DDDDDCAC (on A string, with strummed open D)
DE(D)CD(C) (same as above, but hold the parenthetical notes rather than
play them - quarter notes)
Chorus:
D#D#D#D#D#C#D#(F)(D#)C#D#C# (again, the parenthesis means hold
that note longer)
F#...
The bass part during the verses lends a strong Am-Dm feel to them, so
you can eliminate the C and F on guitar there if you want, though not if
you want to be faithful. Thanks to Matthew and Mick for their careful
observance of my errors. And if you can find the CD single of this, get it,
Nightmare and Fog are great...

You're never there

I've got a nickname for you, I call you weakness
I get a little strength out too, or is it meekness
The more that you want it, the more that you need it
The less that it does
Run out it's rough, too much is enough
And that's what it was
You are a paradox to me, a contradiction
You're a predicament for me, and a prediction

As if you would tell me so

Factory billboards on outskirts of city

Fluorescent bedroom flicker starts to teach me to wonder
Bb F
I hear a mandolin, in the springs
Bb F
Out the wardrobe floats the hint of a rumour
C
Dressed in your beloved's finest things
Bb F
Can you hear the voices that are constantly talking
Bb F
Am I only one to succumb to their roar
Bb F C
Well I know, the form it is taking, it's not making sense anymore
Bb F
The way you say, you just want to help me
Bb F
The way your clinging is slinging me under

The strength I need already denied me, your big ideas and your little
wonder

Some people don't come over because of the problem

I heard the tough guy won't answer his phone

I wonder if he has the same kind of problem, a little difficulty of his
own

So take this plastic and rent me some wheels, or maybe I'll try to fly

No reservations I'll see how it feels

When I'm over your house, up in the sky

And when the sun is squeezing through the blinds, you will be far away

Deep afternoon seeing the moon will have shined

Some notes about MLP:
Bb(add E) is played as a regular Bb barred on fret 1 without the barre:
xx||||
||||||
||ooo|
Also, if you want to play along with the CD you might find a problem. Some of the tracks on my
"Sometime Anywhere" CD are not in perfect pitch. For MLP, I had to tune the guitar down about 1/3
of a semi-tone. You'll see what I mean if you try and get your guitar in tune with the song. As for
you piano players ... my commiserations. :)
But for any of you wanting to do TABs or CRDs for the SA album keep in mind to make sure the song
is in tune. On a couple of the songs I had to tune down about 1/2 a semitone. Other songs were in
perfect tune, so I don't know what was going on in that studio at the time. Brian Adds: When I saw
The Church play this song live it was down a fourth from the recording. It looked much easier to
play too - the opening chords are Fmaj7 and C. On each one lift your first finger off the C, then back
on. I'm sure you get the idea!

I haven't worked out that, but the third and fourth chords
are these ones (any votes for a name?):

The last one of this bridge is C5:

If you play the D and the second E-chord in the verse with the

Verse and Chorus always have these two chords:
Bm D

Oh yeah
Your one and only lie
Ripped from the earth with these bare hands
You dare
Question the ritual
Despite continual
Threats of "gonna get you all"
1 law for the officers
1 for the gentlemen
2 bad you 3 know what it's 4
5 for this awful die
6 for the genetics
7 for the lucky pricks who went into heaven

Bridge 1:
G A Bm G

Nightmare
We ride for miles and miles
Following the howling of our prey
Out there
We load our yellow rigs
Scrambling for shelter
Dig, avoid decay
1 for the flaming sun
2 for the location
3 for the martyrs and the stars
4 for the wind and sand
5 so you understand
6 for the slips twixt the cup and the lips

Bridge 2:
G A Bm G Bm G Bm A

Fm# A F# A
1 for the cockpit blues
2 for the bands and groups
3 for the vast and molten sky
4 for the failed talks
5 for the knives and forks
6 for forbidden kicks
all the others in the sticks

Purple Pagoda added the following riff:

Right Handed: F#-Db
A-Db
I start on the 'D' string, 4th fret with my first finger on the F# and my
third finger on the 'G' string hitting the Db. Then I move to the 7th fret
with my 2nd finger on the 'A' position and my first finger on the 6th fret

Intro: Am F G E7

G         A                   D
Esmerelda falls in love every Saturday
G             A                        D
And on Sunday morning don't remember a thing
G                       A             D
And the gringos are all saints of the latter day, that's the way
G              A               D
And it takes a little pain out of the sting
G    Em              D
Holy water tastes as sweet as wine
G    Em                    D
Holy wine tastes just like blood
F#m                              B
She's drinking for loss, for the man on the cross
G                           A
She says no more, the awful ache
G          A                 D
And in her bedroom there's a mirror there
G            A               D
Sometimes it don't reflect a thing
G            A                  D
And from the street he sees her silhouette, and he can't forget
G        Em            D
That her kisses are as sweet as wine
G       Em                D
And her kisses taste like myrrh
F#m                        B
Her love is lost, like the man on the cross
G                      A
And no more, the awful ache

Middle: Am F G E7

G         A                    D
Esmerelda walks on down to the cemet'ry
G        A                      D
And he's waiting for her in the shade
G                       A              D
With the angels and the sad old trees, patiently
G       A                    D
But she walks right past his grave
F#m                            B
She's crying for loss, for the man on the cross
G                           A

This is Brian's version:

Verse: Em D C D
(The last D is just two beats to move back into the Em. It varies a little,
so don't always play it)
Chorus: C D Em

"All these colors": Am Am/C

After singing the last "all those colours bring me down" you start from a E5
"power chord"

0
0
9
9
7
0

You're then going to move that basic shape down the fret board. Taking the start
position as "7", it goes

7, 5, 3, 2, 5, 3, 2, 0 which corresponds to playing (roughly)
E, D, C, B, D, C, B, A

then end with an E minor, which takes you back into the verse.
And this is Stefan's version:

In case you want to do a piper and play the full jingle jangle (that makes the
chords a bit different):

---------3------|-----2----------|---------0------|---------0------
-------------3--|---------3------|-----3-------3--|-----3-------3--
-----0----------|-------------0--|----------------|----------------
----------------|-0--------------|-2--------------|----------------
----------------|----------------|----------------|-3--------------

I'm doing my takamine-12 solo version with the following chords; this is quite
different from Brian's version:
e7/10 - D - e7 - C9

Verse: Bm D Em Fmaj7 C G Am (rpt)
Chorus: E D C Bm A G D/F# E (rpt)

Fairly straightforward, but I'm particularly impressed by the chorus' chords
(that first E is actually an E5 "power chord"first time round on the record,
with no minor OR major 3rd being played, but acoustically they play it as
E major). Look at those chords - it's a descending "reverse alphabetical order"
run of chords until the second last one. The bass appears to just play the root
note of each chord, except the second D in the chorus.

Opening: F#m D
Rest of the Song: A D9 (change on "they SAY..."),
F#m (on "CAN'T spend..") D

(D9 = D with the high E string left open)

You can hear that even while that loooong A chord is being played, that wonderfully
ragged bass-line keeping popping down to G. Simulate that by lifting two fingers
off the A chord (I think it sounds best when the 3rd and 4th strings are let go,
and the 2nd string's C# remains held).

Stefan Horlitz adds:
Analogically, you can rev up the D9 chord by making it oscillate between D7 and D9.
Do D7 but leave out the F# on the E-string - just with index and middle & use the
ring to do the D9. just in case you haven't a second guitarist to play those
wonderfully out-of-metrum high notes.

OK. This actually works on e-guitar only. this is one of those ultimatetextured
e guitar songs, and you will have to improv a little to make it work on acoustic
guitar. the main trick is to let ring and accidentally, randomly hit some
of the open strings

intro riff - something like e minor with the F played...you can randomly add
the open G, B and e for a little more chordal blubber.

e------------------------------------------------
b------------------------------------------------
g------------------------------------------------
d-----2---2-------2---2-------2---2------2------2
a-----2---2-------2---2-------2---2------2------2
E---1---1-------1---1-------0---0------0------0--

the stinging, devilish descending riff is very simple:
e--12----10--8--7----5--3--
b--12----10--8--7----5--3--
g---9-----7--5--4----2--0--
d---9-----7--5--4----2--0--
a--------------------------
E--------------------------

If you play solo, why not hit the deep E in between, to fake a bass
note, the G also works!

now for the "verses" (this song has no verse-chorus structure), i.e.
the singing bits, your best choice might be the classic power chords.
bang bang chugg chugg!! think smells like teen spirit and play
really really angry!!

Everything is something else these days
I'm dedicated to neutrality
I am the lord of all I survey
This stuff is top quality

Every day is somewhere else this time
I'm driving in a film down a French boulevard
I'm waiting in a cafe on old South Head Road
I'm chopping up guitars with Nic Hard

Everything before the crash ride it out
Drumming up a little crowd, we played and bowed

The actual "chords" of Snowfaller only come to life through the
masterful arrangement - guitar ostinato, varying bass notes, guitar
solo playing and "chords" only here and there. It's a great example
for "Sum of the parts". First, I will provide a kind of chordal
framework, so you can play it on your acoustic.

It's absolutely vital to play that last a minor chord...
it's such a nice and yearning twist

I'm doing all kinds of double-guitar imitations when I'm playing
this one, juxtaposing the stuff on the upper strings against the bass
drones, like this for the intro:

2-3-2-3-5-3-5-3
3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3
2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2

x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x etc.

Make sure to dissolve the descending bits into jangly notes/arpeggi
(just listen to the CD)

and A (D5). Do that if the Cm or Dm sounds too insistent and

Pretty simple actually, if you just wanna strum the chords:
it's all just D, C and G.

D
Eventually
C                             D
We came to a chasm dark and wide
C
And drifted in silence through endless anemones
D
In shallow dreams
C                              D
Life was beginning to take a shape
C
Water was warm as it hastened our enemies
D G C
This kind of world will start a little colony
D G C
This kind of earth will eat a little energy
D G C
This kind of thing needs a little secrecy


The D and C in the verse can be played a bit more interesting,
like shown below (though it's not exactly the way the guitar is
played on the album - however, it's a bit closer to the live acoustic
versions): strum the D, let it ring while descending note by note
from the E-string to the G-string. Then shortly play chord - whatever
its name is - right before the C, and then the C itself. Additionally,
you can let the C chord ring and play around on the B string.

                        song : `
Dust off the chitarronne again, it's Church Time!
Capo on the 7th fret, to get that mandoline-like sound. The rest is
a walk in the sun again. Your children could play it. Though anyone
who has seen Peter's and Marty's hands remembers the extraordinary
size of the gentlemen's fingers. I wonder how they can play that
stuff (or it's Tim or Steve on guitar here...but the solo sounds
ultra-martysh)...

So, grab a guitar, fix the capo on the 7th fret. Song eez een e minor,
and you really need mostly standard chords:

verse goes like this:

e minor, D6, b minor, Cmaj7

b----0----0----0----0
f#---1----0----0----1
d----2----0----0----2
A----2----0----2----3
E----0----x----2----0
B----x----3----0----x

chorus goes like this:

D major, E7/D, Cmaj7, G6add9 (no 5th)

b----3----0----0----0
f#---0----2----1----1
d----0----0----2----2
A----0----2----3----0
E----x----0----0----x
B----3----3----x----x (<-or any other variant of the D shape chord)

..........^grab this with thumb, it's the Harrison chord!!

The chords during the solo are all the same, just slightly reordered.
That's your homework, mates!

                        song : `
Friends, this song is strikingly easy to play. Anyone can play it!
There is a whopping 7 chords to learn, 2 of them are derivates. And
woohoo, once you mastered "Happenstance", you can also play "Disappointment"!

So, first thing we have to do is to capo our guitar at the 5th fret.
Yes, just like in "Under The Milky Way"

The tabs of the chords in order:

d a Fmaj7 Dmaj7 g7 a7 E7

a--0---0--|--0---0--|--1---0--|--2---
e--1---0--|--0---3--|--1---0--|--4---
c--2---0--|--0---2--|--2---0--|--2---
G--2---2--|--2---3--|--0---0--|--4---
D--0---2--|--3---0--|--0---2--|--2---
A------0--|--0------|------0--|--X---

Strum every chord one bar, the little vertical bars indicate "repeat
this two times", ...and encore un fois!!

Let's have a look at what we need -
There's d minor, the key of the song, and a minor, the minor dominant.
This is what "Disappointment" is made of. Then things get interesting.
Fmaj7-->Dmaj7 - a slightly bossanovey chord progression wrapped into
that Churchy Australian romanticism...neat! and then Marty's darker
part...then to E7 and that turnaround back to d -

The first half of the song goes along pretty simple. Start each
chord at the high E string and go down to the low E string a little,
and do it a little bit slower than you usually strum chords:

G           Fmaj7     Em
All that it was was a fine-toothed comb

G    Fmaj7     Em
Only in on the night

etc.

The second half of the song starts with the "heavy" part which is
simpy a D minor.

Then... I'm lost, still have to figure out the "cinematic" part
and the ending...

Your inner song
F#m                 Em

along a simple C, but I'm, not sure here...

Fog confuses the light
E
Some distant reflection
D
Some elusive night

Alright

***Because of the many layers of instruments
(multiple guitars, bass and keyboard) in this song, its
hard to pick out a single way to voice the chords. However,
I find that these chord positions work well.

C                                   A#
Almost polite, they point a finger
Trace the muslin design
Almost as blind, shrug your shoulder
Look what you're leaving behind

Chorus:
G#
On the way out, out of this world
F#
On a day out, out of this world
eoc

Almost apart, I'm divided
With control dots
Almost divine, she takes her time
And she go out of her mind
(Chorus)

Bridge:

C#                                      F#
Hey there, please come and stay with me now
C#
Beneath the arches of our sky
F#
Beneath the curse that sucks you dry

Almost a prize, I can't believe it
Right between the eyes
Almost a man, almost master
Almost also-ran
Look what you're leaving behind

C9                C
You arrive here unexplained
Fmaj7
I can't believe the chance you took
Emin7        G
I can't believe you're back again
C9                       C
Sister, come in from the rain
Fmaj7
Those images are faded now
Emin7    G
We shouldn't bring them back again
Fmaj7            G                      Amin
In the othertime, in a bargain basement
G
You were recognized
Fmaj7                  G                    Amin
Then from time to time, much to my amazement
G
With each ensuing episode
D7sus4
Your elegance, it really showed
C9                     C
Buildings blossom into view
Fmaj7
Landscapes change and people blur
Emin7       G
I can't believe this interests you
C9                       C
I read that bedtime interview
Fmaj7
I wish they wouldn't print those things
Emin7          G
It only makes it hard for you
Fmmaj7                G
In the othertime....

The chord progression is constant throughout, and is
fairly simple. Play it palm-muted, with a steady right
hand (think power chords).

The chords are:

G#           4665xx
F#           2443xx
Fminor       1331xx
C#(sus2[?])  x4664x

Just repeat those four chords throughout.
It is very easy to follow the recording.

When I jammed along my guitar I suddenly played a chord
that sounded familiar to me. After an hour of thinking and
jamming on I remembered it being from a live recording of
This Asphalt Eden, from which I then made this transcription.

Em7/A      [x09780]
Fmaj7/A    [x07560]
E/A        [x06450]

Verse:

Em7/A  Fmaj7/A    Em7/A               Fmaj7/A
I walk alone,     this asphalt eden I must have outgrown

Em7/A          Fmaj7/A   Em7/A             Fmaj7/A
Just flesh and bone,     no indication, no way to get home

Em7/A     Fmaj7/A
Now feel their hands,

Em7/A      Fmaj7/A
and their demands

Em7/A      Fmaj7/A                E/A
and understand the way that it could have been

Chorus:

When you walk past my cage I'm gonna set myself free

Chorus

I enjoy this song as it is recorded, but there is alot more
electronic sounds than guitar. Hearing Kilbey play it live
on guitar only convinced me that it was originally composed
on/for the guitar. The chords are all played first position.
On the D5, the bass and keyboards imply a minor tone, but I
believe the guitar simply plays the D5:

---------0--
---------3--
---------2--
---------0--
---------0--
---------x--

Also, on the E-minor in the chorus, the other instruments imply
a seventh tone, but the guitar plays E-minor only. I hope someone
can find interest in playing this song, it is classic Kilbey

Chords used:
G5 :        320033
C9+5 :      032033 - weird name, simple concept. Just move two fingers down from the
G5 chord.
Eb Thingy : X65066

The C9 chord moved up by three frets - no barre. Let the G string ring clearly and
BLOCK THAT LOW E!! Steve didn't do so at a concert and stopped the song half way
through because something sounded *really* ... ummm.... "discordant". The low E
ringing through the chorus was the cause.

Db Thing: X43044

Same as the previous chord but down two frets. The G is still ringing clearly and
that
nasty low E should be blocked.

OK, after that lot the song is fairly simple.

Verse:

G C9 (repeat)

Chorus:

Eb Thingy Db Thingy C9

The only tweak I can suggest is when you switch from G to C9 in the chorus try
and sometimes hit the 2nd fret on the G string. This adds an "A" to the chord and lets
you hint at what the bassline is doing in the recording.

Here is English Kiss from Narcosis +. It is basically a two chord song,
though there seems to be a passing G tone between the Fmaj7 and Amin. The
guitar tracks on the album feature quite a bit of wah pedal rocking back and
forth (very tasty). The keyboard fill in the intro can be played on the
guitar using the Harmonic Minor scale. Something like this:

e...................................................................
B...................................................................
G.............................................................5.....
D.............................................5.........7..........
A........................5......7.....8............................
E...5......7.....8..................................................

About the mad tiger

He licks the skin off the women.

Have you prayed, have you chanted

With the symbols and incense
Amin
To both Krishna and Buddha

And the Goddess of Fortune

For an Indian lover

To wake Kundalini

Your beautiful Yonni

But also Iscariot

Who comes to betray us

With just one English Kiss.
Amin
Deep in the autumn
Fmaj7
I lie in my bedroom
Amin
Just one more long shadow
Fmaj7
Fall into the corners
Amin
I reach for a woman
Fmaj7
Who harbors in darkness
Amin
She lands on a mountain
///
Sways for a moment
Fmaj7
Crashes in pieces all over my eyes.
Amin
All over my eyes
Chord progression remains the same throughout
And when you get tired
Of fake little evenings
Slip through your fingers
And don't keep their promise
Such a sad vision
It breaks up my daydream
Such a sad vision, breaks up my daydream

Look up that sleeve, where is the rabbit
Already secreted along with the dove
Where is the passion, already depleted
Just like the love.

Can you imagine what I can manage
With your permission, with your consent.
I know what you're thinking
Hear what you're saying, How could I ever?
I know what you like.
I think I know what you like.
I'm sure I know what you like.
You should give it attention
You should give it attention
You should give it some thought
You should give me a night
You should give me a night
I know what you like

What a fantastic song!! I love it.
The chords are always going in this scheme: em C D em G em
with one exception: a hm in the next to last verse

em
The day we left for January
C
The maelstroms lashed outside/our side [0:45]
D
Tore us away from the glass world obeyed/of faith [0:50]
em      G       em
Where the impulse engines died

We scrambled up the crow's nest
Could not believe our luck
Our terrified cries vibrated through the sky
Lightning and thunder struck

Down and down and down
Drowning in yourself
Down and down and down

The sargeant was a drunkard
The wing commander bent
We crashed one night on the other side
Just past the Duke of Kent

Passengers were a lethal lot
Hanging the loud in the nets
They dreamed and screamed as we picked up steam
In the mouth of the rivulet

The mutineers were scabby darks [2:50]
Howling for our blood
Behind her whip [2:56] up and down the ship
We hurled into the flood

The enemy ??? [3:05]
Lays here like a saw
We shudder in her wake like a damaged snake
We didn't get too far

The sea was a vast mosaic
Fallen to disrepair
The sky was aglow like the chaos below

-- here comes the exception, just one line --
hm
As the first shots filled the air

The charge swept off our captain's leg
So they put him in a barrel of graphite
Commanding from the fray as his blood ran away
His soul fled to the light

It continues in the same fashion and progression. The lead and
accompaniment parts are not too terribly hard to approximate.
Keep a tight right hand.

Elegantly simple, brilliant song.
The line 'stampeding stallions of foam...' seems to be a tip of the
hat to a brief scene in the old animated version of Tolkien's Lord
of the Rings, in which one of the magicians had added frothy white
horse figures to a spell of a rushing wave of water, as a personal
touch. I haven't seen that film since I was just a kid, I don't
recall too much about it......

I hope someone can use this song; I have never transcribed a song
online before, so please forgive any glaring mistakes.

cheers, Noel

                        song : `
One of the songs that I had wanted to figure out (on guitar) more than
anything was You Whisper, off of MWP's Art Attack. For the longest time
(2 years or so) I couldn't. This made me less than pleased. [Fast
forward to present.] I've been playing around with a riff that faintly
reminded me of something I've heard before, but couldn't quite place it.
Then it struck me: You Whisper (okay, so you saw that coming--I didn't).
I threw the CD in and figured it out in about six minutes (many of those
minutes spent figuring out that he uses a capo (: ). Anyway, I was very
happy. Here it is:

*capo 2nd fret

-------------------------------------------------------------------
repeat

chorus:

Am G/B C C/G (x32013)

G

I'm not 100% on the arpeggiations, but i believe that the chords and the
walk-downs are right. I was happy to figure it out.

Now sure stampeding, stumbling
Clawing, bleeding, clawing, bleeding

To where I am now

I'm a coin that won't stop spinning
Can't tell if I'm winning
Exposed by the commitments of choosing
When winning's losing
It's so confusing
The climax to the last hot moment

Spinning, singing, turning, burning, growing, flowing
I'm spinning
I'm singing
I'm turning
I'm burning

This song will be easier to play if your hand if your fingers start each figure
in the right position, as shown below.

I will also write in the tab what "chord" your hand should be playing.
Much of this song just requires your hand ready to play a certain chord, but you
pick out a melody instead. I'll put the chord in single quotes. e.g 'Am'
First Bar Second Bar (C Chord) Third Bar (D add 5)

What I haven't written out is the bridge section and the lead-in to it. The
reason is that it is played just by playing the following chords, but one
note at a time, etc, nothing that needs explicit note-for-note transcription.

So, you've played the two verses, here comes the bridge.

(This is the end of last verse...)

A               D     D C9 D G Gsus4
Will I start to bleed ?
Em       B7                Em
Magnetic field around your heart
B7               Em
I'm sure I felt the engines start
B7                C
But what if all the fuel runs out ?

Lyrics:
Silence floats into the room
Whispers to me out of tune
And I wonder if these deadly
Awkward moments stay
Stabbing their spikes in me
Will I start to bleed ?
Raise your eyes until they're mine
Lift yourself towards the light
Your face looks like a
Waterfall to me
If I concede, what is it gonna mean ?
Will I start to bleed ?
(Bridge as written above)
Glad I didn't stay with you
So much more for me to do
I am free like Matthieu in the
Age of reason
But somethin' is missing
Will I start to bleed ?

Here's Al Fasoli's version of the song:

CHORDS:

D2      = xxx032
Dsus2   = xx0230
Dsus4   = xx0233
D6      = xx0202

INTRO:

[C]Silence[D]floats into[Dsus4]the[Dsus2]room[Dsus4].
[C]Whispers[D]to me [Dsus4]out of[Dsus2]tune[Dsus4].

[D]And I[Dsus4]wonder[Dsus2]if these[D2]deadly[D6]awkward[D2] moments[D]stay.
[D2]Stabbing their spikes in[D2]me. [D2]Will I[D]start to[D2]bleed[D].

[E-]I'm sure I[Dsus4] felt the engine[Asus2]start.
[E-]But what if[Dsus4]all the fuel runs[Asus2]out[Dsus2].

INTRO

Glad I didn't stay with you. So much more for me to do.
I'm free like Mathieu. In the Age of Reason.
But something is missing. Will I start to bleed.
ALL PARTS ARE LIKE THE FIRST WITH THE EXCEPTION

NOTES:
This tab is from the version that appears on the Fairy Light Nights album
(I've heard a few live versions and they all seem to be slightly different).
I've worked it out on a 6 string although the version on the album is played
on a 12 string. Hopefully the sound difference between the two hasn't caused
any glaring errors.

The sky is pressing down. And it tears me from my sleep.
I fall onto the ground. And the goarse rips at my skin.
I scratch my eyes and open wide.

The dizzy spell has gone. The tablet dissolved.
The ache has left its mark. A not forgotten scar.
I try the door,again it's locked.
And time stands still,on the broken clock.

BRIDGE..........

In the hallway where I stand. I see pictures on the wall.
They're all places that I've been. And I loved.
The back door and the front door are exactly the same.
The floors they are the ceiling and the walls the window pane.

The initial creative core consisted of Coventry-born Julianne Regan (vocals), Huddersfield-born Tim Bricheno (guitar) and Andy Cousin (bass guitar), with other members changing over the years. Their highest-charting UK single was "Martha's Harbour" (1988). The band was active from 1984 to 1993, then 1999 to 2004, achieving four UK Top-50 albums. The band had been recognised for their "unique, folk-rock-influenced take" on the gothic rock style, and Regan has been described as "certainly one of the more talented singers" of the scene in the late 1980s.`,

A|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
E|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
A/C# means that you play an A chord with the bass is C#.
The ^ sign means stretching the string up (listen to the song.)
Also the playing of the 2323 parts is faster and is actually off beat.
The backing is the same as in the verse.

Part 2: Verse

Then the first half of the verse is repeated twice with the exception
that the last chord leading to the next part is an F and not G/B.

Part 3: Intro to chorus
Do you   remember walking   out the day it      rained forever

In the second half of this section, although the chords remain the same,
the bass goes C,D,E,F - to emphesize that we play the last 4 strings of
the chords only - it makes the difference !

Part 4: Chorus - It's the same as the intro. You can play it like this:
D2               A/C#             C2               G/B

Part 5: The REAl reason why we gathered here... THE GUITAR SOLO!
Well, sit tight, and don't try this at home! (no, try!)
I personally manage somehow to survive the first part of the solo,
but the second one - I can only write it! (even working it out was not
a bed of roses!)
O.K here we go:

Song Structure:

D2                   A/C#
Six o'clock, all the closing shops
C              G/B
And the rainbows on the pavements
D2     A/C#      C       G/B
Of a sleepy town.
D2                  A/C#
October leaves were wept from the trees
C                          G/B
In tears of grief and strange relief
D2  A/C#     C       F
And sympathy.... all for me.
C           G           Am
Do you remember walking out
F
The day it rained forever
C            G/D
And you were wondering
Am/E                F
If I held dreams of wedding rings
D2 A/C#     C          G/B
Well, farewell Mr. Sorrow
D2 A/C#      C
Farewell Mr. Sorrow
G/B
Tomorrow is my own.
(...Jumping to middle section)
Am G F#m F Em C Em Bb x2
Am     Bm            C     D2
So this is how a Judas kisses
Em C Em Bb
F
Well, this is my kiss.

Tab Key:
YbZ - bend the note at fret Y to the same pitch
as the note found at fret Z
/ - slide up
\\ - slide down
X - mute with palm of picking hand
U - upstroke
D - downstroke
V - volume swell
() - incidental note
[] - echo note
~ - hold note
rake - exagerate the strumming of the chord
(but not enough for it to be an arpeggio)

Notes:
In the intro and verses Guitar 1 uses a volume pedal to swell all the notes.
There are alot of 'noise' effects in the intro and background of the verses. The same noise track is
used for both verses. If you want to recreate this,its going to be down to your own experimentation
- as results will depend on what equipment you own.
In choruses 1, 2 and 4 Guitar 1 plays notes based on E, A and Dsus2 chord shapes. This part can be
heard clearest in the left hand side stereo channel. Guitar 2 plays the powerchords, sounding
clearest in the right hand side stereo channel. Chorus 3 differs in that it uses diads, as in the
'Stratospheric Preaching' section.
The 'Stratospheric Preaching' section uses diads for the first 8 bars. The last 8-bars are similar to a
standard chorus.
In Guitar solo 1, the right hand stereo channel has the clean guitar. In the left hand channel the solo
has delay/echo added. The backing for the solo is most prominant in the left hand channel - It can
be tricky to pick out as it blends in with the delayed solo guitar signal. The backing track played by
Guitar 1 is based around a 3-octave pattern, using the root note of the implied backing chord. For
the last 4-bars Guitar 2 is present.
Guitar solo 2 is difficult to hear, as Guitar 3 is low in the mix. This solo is based on the E-minor
pentatonic scale. The backing for the solo is similar to a standard chorus.

                    Song Structure:

                    Intro:
                    1 x Part 1 (note that a chorus follows, so use special bar 4)
                    Chorus:

                    D D9 D11 D
                    Madeleine hears the bohemians say
                    G
                    She's selfish and crazy
                    Am D D9 D11
                    Which isn't so far from the truth,
                    D G
                    She's the essence of youth,
                    Am D D9 D11 D
                    The flower you place on eternity's grave.
                    G Am
                    The romantic who isn't afraid
                    D D9

                    Of the beat of her heart,
                    D11 D G
                    She raises a glass to your art
                    Am
                    And when she gets drunk she says...
                    Bridge to chorus:
                    2 x Part 1 (second time introduces chorus with different bar 4)
                    G Em Bm
                    Oh, give me the autumn, give me the trees,
                    C
                    Gather up everything I ever wanted
                    G
                    And give it me, please
                    Em Bm
                    Give me the ocean, give me the sea
                    C
                    Gather up everything I ever wanted

                    Bridge

                    Chorus
                    2 x Part 2
                    Middle Part
                    7 x Part 4
                    1 x Part 4 Variation 1

                    Chorus
                    2 x Part 2
                    2 x Part 2 Variation 1
                    Last chord is G (surprise, surprise...)

                    Notes:
                    Part 1:
                    Harmonically, for the first three bars, everything is quite ok, but bar 4 seems somewhat strange

                    since none of the notes picked by guitar are part of the C-Major chord, although they all fit into C-
                    Major scale and into G-Major scale (song is in G-major). Hmm, seems strange, but works somehow...

                    If you like to play along on your own (without keyboard or CD/MC/LP running in background),
                    here's what I used for part 1 when I did some acoustic gigs or when I play on my own :

                    G
                    E|------5-----|------5-----|------5-----|------5-----|
                    B|---3-----3--|--03-0--03-0|---3-----3--|---3-0--03--|
                    G|--4--4--4--4|------------|--4--4--4--3|--0---------|
                    D|-5----------|-2----------|-4----------|-2----------|
                    A|------------|------------|2-----------|3-----------|
                    E|3-----------|0-----------|------------|------------|
                    Part 2:
                    It's not noted here how the chords are strummed for guitar 2, since this would be too complicated.
                    Just listen to the record and try to catch up with MWP, which isn't that easy at first (at least it wasn't
                    for me, especially in verses). It's a good right hand training...
                    If you play on your own without a second guitarist (and which one of us has one at hand if he needs
                    him/her), just use the part of guitar 2, add the introduction notes for G-Chord of guitar 2 and strum
                    all 6 string at the beginning of a bar (the missing frets of muted strings should be quite clear...)
                    Part 3:
                    Sorry if the names of the different D-chords aren't correct... my musical-theory knowledge got stuck
                    in a traffic jam and couldn't drop by when I was doing this transcription. Noting the strumming
                    would have been to complicated here, as for Part 2.
                    Part 4:
                    Noting the strumming would have been to complicated here, as for Parts 2 and 3 Note that these are
                    neither minor nor major chords, so the chord names noted above aren't correct. Nevertheless,
                    concerning the harmonic of the song, they are major chords are the right choice.

The nice thing here is that we can actually play both the lead and the
backing chords at the same time - this really sounds genuine!
Once in every chord shift, the second bit is a single note and the rest
are chords, which gives the mixed feeling.

The only difference between the 2 halves of the verse is
the insertion of the second guitar on the Em. I know -
it's easier typed than played! But even if you get somehow
close to it then it's probably enough .
Part 3: Chorus - exactly like the second half of the intro!
Part 4: Middle section
Simply playing the following sequence of chords 4 times :
Em G F# F

The guitar solo is also based on the intro/chorus chords, and since
it is somewhat blurred I can't think of any special notes for it.

3. Verse (3x Part 2)
Repeat Chorus (4x Part 1)

Notes:
This song is surprisingly simple although it kicks you right between the eyes when you first hear it.
Almost only simple major and minor chords are used, except one minor seven, which, in my
opinion, gives the song what is so special about it (in combination with the vast use of strings, the
incredible melody-line and the arrangement, which begins very calm and ends in a explosion of
sounds).
The first part is used for verses as well as chorus, which also includes some piano/keyboard. The
second part is the one between the verses and chorus and uses almost the same picking scheme as
the first part, only the chords differ.
Since the chords of part 3 are not played by guitar (strings are used here), I tried to figure out the
correct chords and added a guitar-picking of my own, which I hope is somewhat ok. I also noted
what I think the distorted guitar plays during this part (This is somewhat hard to figure out since it
is not clear which part is strings and which is guitar...)

Verse:
Ride on the storm I made
I glide on the ashes of the sky
My blue raincoat makes me say "No today"
Hey, when does weather ever change?
Chorus:
Some finer day (some finer day)
Say things go my way
Some finer day (some finer day)
I'll play your sunshiny girl

Verse:
Ride the mercury with me
See how unpredictable it feels
Red-bus shelter where we fell to the ground
Found out that weather never changed
Chorus:
Some finer day (some finer day)
Say things go my way
Some finer day (some finer day)
I'll be your sunshiny girl
Bridge:
And brighten up my world
With sunflowers and book I have burned
And see what you want me to see
I'll be what you want me to be
Chorus:
Some finer day (some finer day)
Say things go my way
Some finer day (some finer

Just the basic chords for "Diviner" - the keyboard notes are easy; they pedal
between the D and G strings. During the chorus, an electric six string plays
arpeggiated
versions of the chords below.
This is the chorus/main keyboard riff, transcribed for guitar: Live, I use a Boss CE-5
chorus
with a Mooer Analogue Echo pedal to really draw out the sound of each note.

* 3/4 in the verse, but with the one bar after the Gadd6-chord played 4/4 again
C x32010
F/D xx0565
Gadd6 320030
Fmaj7 x33210
Am x02210
C F/D C F/D C
They packed us up in bo- xes, wooden bo- xes
Gadd6 C
And sent us home
F/D C F/D C
Underneath the wil- low, near the ri- ver
Gadd6 C
By my headstone
If you do some picking like this, you get
quite close to how it is played:
C F/D C F/D C Gdd6 C (do some picking stuff)
|0---------5-----|0----------5----|0---------------|0---------------|

|--0-------------|--0-------------|--0-------------|----------------|
|-2--------0-----|-2---------0----|-2--------------|----------------|
|3---------------|3---------------|3---------------|----------------|
|----------------|----------------|---------3------|3---------------|
Chorus:
Am Fmaj7 C
And all you do is carry on
play the "carry on"-part like this:
C Am

..on.. ...when all you do
It's snowing now it's winter, river's frozen
And still you come
I can almost see you, and touch you
My pretty one
When all you do is carry on

                        song : `
When Steve plays this song live it is a bit different than
the original song on the Jack Frost album. Here are the chords
for the album version:
It's just two groups of chords, changed quickly - meaning that
you only have to pull one finger on and off one string:
D5 xx0235
Dsus4 xx0233
Em9/A x02032
Em7/A x02030
D-chords Em-chords
Remember when I told you
D-chords Em-chords
You were pretty lost
On Steve's Acoustic & Intimate, there are a few more chords, and Steve
plays the D-chords in the verse a bit different:
Dsus2 xx0230 (instead of D5)
Em7/D xx0030 (instead of Dsus4)
Steve plays the end of the chorus sometimes like this:
Em7/G 3x0030
Em7/F# 2x0030
Em7 02x030
Dsus2.. Em7/G
All I have, all I need
Em7/F# Em7
All I got is providence
